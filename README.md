Engineer at Intuit/Mailchimp.

I love finding efficient solutions to real-world problems, and enjoy imbuing client UX with the appeal and responsiveness I learned from half a decade in animation. 

Outside of work I am a rookie rock climber, mma enthusiast, board game aficionado, nature nerd, and temporarily grounded hang glider pilot. I grew up in Japan and am culturally and conversationally fluent in Japanese.

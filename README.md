Recent software engineer at BombBomb. Ex-Pixar animator with 6 years in film and animation. 

I love finding efficient solutions to real-world problems, and enjoy imbuing client UX with the appeal and responsiveness I learned from half a decade in animation. 

Outside of work I'm a martial arts junkie, board game aficionado, nature enthusiast, and temporarily grounded hang glider pilot. I grew up in Japan and am culturally and conversationally fluent in Japanese.

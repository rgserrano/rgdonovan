Regina is an experienced fullstack web developer with a half a decade's experience in animation. Her background in the arts underpins and informs her passion for building for appealing and responsive client-facing UX. In her free time she's converting her front yard to a garden that's the all talk of her neighborhood, and spending way too many hours every week journeying down the long path of self-mastery through martial arts.

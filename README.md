A fullstack web developer with a half a decade's experience in animation at Pixar. My experiences in film and art inform my ability to create appealing and responsive client-facing UX; my work at BombBomb and on Lodge have taught me much in the way of backend work and sustaining both centralized and distributed web applications. In my free time I'm converting my front yard to a family-fueling food garden, and journeying down the long path of self-mastery and self-discipline through martial arts.

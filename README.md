Software Engineer and author of Lodge, an opinionated observability solution for distributed systems: https://lodge-logging.github.io/ 

I'm a seasoned fullstack dev with half a decade's experience in animation at Pixar. My experiences in film inform my ability to craft appealing and responsive client-facing UX; my work at BombBomb and on Lodge demonstrate my capacity for architecting and maintaining backend systems. In my free time I'm converting my front yard to a family-fueling food garden, and journeying down the long path of self-mastery and self-discipline through martial arts.

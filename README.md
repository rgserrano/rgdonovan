Regina is an experienced web developer and expert self-teacher, with a half a decade's experience in animation at Pixar that underpins and informs her passion for fullstack web development. In her free time she's converting her front yard to a garden that's the talk of the neighborhood, and spending way too many hours every week journeying down the long path of self-mastery through martial arts.
